[Timepix]%
{The Timepix chip evolved from the \gls{medipix2} development. The pixels have identical size to those of \gls{medipix2} but the functionality within each pixel has been changed. In Timepix each pixel can be programmed to count hits like \gls{medipix2}, or to record Time-Over-Threshold (providing rough analog information), or to measure arrival time of the first particle to impinge on the pixel}%
