    The validation of a direct semiconductor neutron detector technology serves as a milestone for future neutron imaging and portable detection systems.
    While many of the \gls{high-res} systems are semi-permanently installed in their home beam line, the \gls{lisepix} system maintains the portability of similar devices built on the \gls{timepix} platform, including \gls{usb} stick devices and CubeSats \cite{Turecek_2011, Baca_2016, Egner_2016}.
    A rough estimate of the projected equipment cost for a hypothetical \Xmath{4\times} \gls{lisepix} instrument, extrapolated from a single \gls{timepix} system, has been listed in \Xreftable*{lisepix-cost}.
    These costs may be reduced by access to fabrication facilities and/or collaboration with manufacturers.
    It should also be noted that the bulk of the cost stems from the upfront purchase of the main processing module required to drive the \gls{timepix} \glspl{asic}.
    This cost may be mitigated or eliminated if an alternative system is already available or a custom design is implemented by the production team.
