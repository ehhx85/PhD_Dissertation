    \Glsname{lise} offers tremendous potential for neutron sciences including detection, imaging, \glsname{ct-neutron} and potentially spectroscopy.
    Demand continues to grow for access to neutron imaging facilities for materials engineering, biological and pharmaceutical studies, and fundamental nuclear physics sciences, among many others.
    As technology progresses, neutron beam lines will be able to produce more refined fluxes with higher intensity, while \glsplname{cans} will dramatically boost the accessibility of neutron imaging to the broader scientific community.
    The utility of \glsname{lise} will come at the intersection of supporting \gls{high-res} imaging, while offering a sustainable, portable neutron detection platform, crucial for national security applications.
