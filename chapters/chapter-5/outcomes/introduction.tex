    The principal aim of this research was accomplished, having fabricated and tested a \gls{high-res} neutron imager.
    Operating in semiconductor mode, \gls{lise} introduces a novel platform for direct conversion semiconductor neutron detection.
    The \gls{lisepix} system successfully combined the proprietary neutron sensitive compound, \glschemical{lise6}, with the industry standard \gls{timepix}, to produce a neutron imaging system capable of resolving features down to the device limit prescribed by the \SI{55}{\micro\meter} pixel pitch.
    Furthermore, in this research, \gls{lise} achieved a material spatial resolution of \SI{34}{\micro\meter} with the \gls{mtf} (\SI{111}{\micro\meter} using the \gls{fwhm}) operating in both scintillator and semiconductor modes, requiring only \SI{150}{\second} and \SI{400}{\second} exposures, respectively.
