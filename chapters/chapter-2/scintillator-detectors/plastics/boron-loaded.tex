    \citeauthor*{Normand_2002} presented a \SI{5}{\percentweight} boron-loaded \gls{plastic:ps} scintillator for neutron detection.
    This proprietary mixture reduced the material cost by a factor of \num{4} compared to the Bicron BC454 plastic scintillator with similar boron content.
    Cylindrically shaped, the samples measured \SI{15}{\centi\meter} long by \SI{4}{\centi\meter} in diameter, with the proprietary material demonstrating equivalent or superior performance over the Bicron scintillator \cite{Normand_2002}.
    \citeauthor*{Pawelczak_2014} presented a boron-loaded palstic scintillator using \gls{psd} to detect thermal neutrons.
    The scintillators were \SI{2.5}{\centi\meter} diameter by \SI{1}{\centi\meter} thickness, composed of \gls{plastic:ppo} (\SI{28}{\percent}) in \gls{plastic:pvt} or \gls{plastic:ps}, with \gls{carborane} supplying the boron component.
    The samples tested possessed \SIlist{0.06;0.11;0.3;0.74}{\percentweight} concentration of \isotope[10]{B} with the highest concentration simulated at \SI{84}{\percent} detection efficiency using a thickness of \SI{1}{\centi\meter} \cite{Pawelczak_2014}.
    \citeauthor*{Mahl_2016} fabricated a series of plastic scintillators using \gls{b2pin2} and \gls{plastic:pvt} as the primary base with varying amounts of \gls{plastic:ppo} to balance the mixture.
    As a source of \isotope[10]{B}, the \gls{b2pin2} additive (\SI[per-mode=symbol]{0.50}[\$]{\per\gram}) offered a lower cost solution for plastic scintillators.
    By overdoping the mixture with \gls{plastic:ppo}, the scintillator exhibited \gls{psd} capabilities, detecting \glspl{neutron-thermal} with \SI{1}{\percentweight} boron content \cite{Mahl_2016}.
    \citeauthor*{Mahl_2018} later developed a synthesis process for boron-loaded \gls{plastic:pvt} based scintillators using \gls{boric-acid} as a precursor.
    The low cost acid precursor (\SI[per-mode=symbol]{1.74}[\$]{\per\gram}), enriched to \SI{96}[>]{\percent} \isotope[10]{B}, is processed into \gls{mbb}, soluble in \gls{plastic:pvt}.
    For a \isotope[10]{B} concentration of \SI{0.05}{\percentweight} the light yield measured \SI{9790}{\lightyield} versus \SI{5940}{\lightyield} for the \SI{1.06}{\percentweight} sample \cite{Mahl_2018}.
