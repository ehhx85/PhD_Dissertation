    Exhibiting some of the best recorded spatial resolutions to date, \gls{gadox} scintillator screens are implemented nearly identical to \gls{lif-zns} screens.
    \citeauthor*{Toetzke_2011} reported the use of \gls{gadox} layers ranging from \SIrange{5}{30}{\micro\meter}, yielding spatial resolutions from \SIrange{25}{61}{\micro\meter}.
    For thermal neutrons, a \SI{10}{\micro\meter} thick layer was able to absorb up to \SI{90}{\percent} of the incident neutrons \cite{Toetzke_2011}.
    A popular manufacturer of neutron sensitive scintillator screens, \gls{rc-tritec} reports a \num{5} times decrease in \gls{ly} for a \gls{gadox} screen compared to \gls{lif-zns} (\SI{50}{\micro\meter} thickness).
    In additon, the light output spectrum from \gls{lif-zns} exhibits a single broad peak, while the light output spectrum from \gls{gadox} screens feautures multiple sharp peaks, with a maximum intensity peak at \SI{549}{\nano\meter}.
    Combining the two scintillator compounds has been shown to boost the overall \gls{ly} without affecting the spatial resolution \cite{website:RC-TRITEC}.
    A key drawback when using a gadolinium based scintillator screen is the large amount of secondary radiation produced in the screen, particularly \glspl{x-ray} and \glspl{gamma-ray}, requiring additional distance and shielding for experiments using this type of scintillator.
    Further progress in \gls{gadox} neutron imaging is discussed in \Xrefsection{chapter-2:advanced-detectors:neutron-microscope}, covering recent advancements in ultra \gls{high-res} imaging.
