    Neutron imaging is a contemporary subscience within the broader study of radiation detection.
    More generally, radiological imaging requires a deep understanding of the interactions between the various types of radiation and the materials with which they interact.
    This section describes the types of radiation encountered in radiological imaging experiments along with their interaction mechanisms.
