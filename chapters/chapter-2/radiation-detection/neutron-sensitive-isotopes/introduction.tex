    Isotopes with large interaction cross sections are useful in neutron detection.
    Because neutrons do not interact with charge carriers directly, the incident radiation must first react with a nucleus before it can produce an observable signal.
    The resultant daughter products offer a means of sensing the neutron interactions, generating directly observable photons or charge carriers.
    The following isotopes play an important role in neutron detection and/or imaging, each offering a range of benefits and restrictions based on intended application.
