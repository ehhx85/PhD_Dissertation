    Radiation sensitive materials may also be designed to operate as semiconductors.
    Unlike scintillators, a radiation semiconductor requires an active voltage bias through the bulk material for operation.
    The bias creates an internal electrical field, suitable for separating the charged particles created during radiation interactions.
    Capturing these charge carriers allows semiconductors to record information about the incident radiation including energy, position and source intensity.
