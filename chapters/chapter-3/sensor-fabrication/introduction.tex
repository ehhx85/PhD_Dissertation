    Radiation detection and imaging begins with the construction of the acquisition system.
    At the most basic level, a radiation detector requires a sensing apparatus, and signal processing hardware.
    In \gls{solid-state} imaging, the sensing apparatus or material generally consists of a thin film, substrate or refined bulk crystalline material.
    Solids offer increased atomic packing, resulting in higher density and smaller form factor to achieve desirable detection efficiency.
    Detector grade \gls{lise} presents itself as a single crystal bulk material, destined for operation as either scintillator or semiconductor detector.
    The following section discusses the preparation of \gls{lise} sensors for integration with both operational modes.
    Particular focus is given to semiconductor detectors, due to inherent system complexity and novelty in the neutron imaging field.
