    The radiation detection system was designed around the sensing material, \glsdesc{lise}, and the anticipated neutron radiation.
    At the most basic level, the detection system consists of the sensor, and the readout electronics used to convert the charge produced by the radiation interaction into electronic signals.
    During the prototyping phase, various enclosures and readout systems were tested in attempts to refine the signal produced from the \gls{lise} sensors.
