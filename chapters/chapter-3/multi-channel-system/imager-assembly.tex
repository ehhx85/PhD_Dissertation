    The operational \gls{lise16} offers a modular design, shown in \Xreffigure*{lise-imager-lid-open}.
    With the top lid removed, the sensor \gls{pcb} floats above the bottom half of the enclosure, suspended by the aluminum grounding bracket.
    The lid is slid on from the left, firmly securing the sensor \gls{pcb} in one of the slots cut into the sidewall.
    Arching jumper wires were used to connect the sensor \gls{pcb} and the \gls{preamp} module, preventing high resistivity pinch points.
    The large yellow input capacitors were rated for \gls{high-voltage} applications, supporting the use of highly resistive sensors biased up to \SI{2}{\kilo\volt}.
    In this configuration, each \gls{cr110} module could be visually inspected for damage (usually indicated by bubbling under the polymer film coating) and quickly replaced.
