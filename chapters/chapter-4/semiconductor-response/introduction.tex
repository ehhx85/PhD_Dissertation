    Neutron imaging systems must be sensitive to neutrons, however, their ability to detect or discriminate against other types of radiation is important for real world usage.
    In most neutron experiments, a mixed radiation field is present, requiring robust system capable of handling a variety of conditions.
    For the \gls{lise} semiconductor technology, a gambit of radiation exposure studies have been conducted to evaluate the sensitivity to other classes of radiation.
