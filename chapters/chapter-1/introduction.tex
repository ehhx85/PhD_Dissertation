    Digital images have become commonplace in everyday life, with mobile devices including smartphones, tablets, digital cameras, and laptops able to capture and display these images with unprecedented clarity and definition. 
    The human visual system is tuned to light in the aptly named visible spectrum, or electromagnetic waves ranging from around \SIrange{390}{700}{\nano\meter}.
    While the visible world consists of vibrant colors, forming a plethora of information stockpiled in digital images, there exists even more secrets invisible to the naked eye. 
    Outside of the visual spectrum, the broader electromagnetic spectrum and various forms of particle \gls{radiation} illuminate the hidden world.
    Neutron imaging grants a unique view into a variety of natural and man-made systems.
